#  FMCG Data Engineering Pipeline (Databricks | Delta Lake | S3)
## Overview

Built an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using **Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake, and AWS S3**, implementing the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** with **incremental processing and MERGE-based upserts** for multi-source data.

The project simulates a real-world FMCG scenario involving:

*  Parent Company: **Atlikon**
*  Child Company: **Sports Bar**


##  Architecture

* Data ingested from **S3 landing layer**
* Processed through:

  * Bronze (raw data)
  * Silver (cleaned & transformed)
  * Gold (aggregated analytics)
* Final data stored in **Delta tables**

## Business Logic
Integrated data from two different companies with conflicting schemas into a single source of truth.


##  Key Features

###  Full Load Processing

* Initial historical data ingestion
* Built base datasets for analysis


###  Incremental Processing

* Processed only new incoming data
* Used **staging tables**
* Identified incremental months
* Avoided reprocessing full dataset


###  Upsert (MERGE) Logic

* Used **Delta Lake MERGE**
* Handled:

  * Updates
  * Inserts
* Ensured no duplicate records


###  Medallion Architecture

| Layer  | Description                    |
| ------ | -------------------------------|
| Bronze | Raw data from S3               |
| Silver | Cleaned and transformed data   |
| Gold   | Aggregated,business-ready data |


###  Multi-Source Data Consolidation

* Sports Bar data processed fully (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
* Atlikon parent data already available at Gold layer
* Final step:
   **Merged child data into parent Gold table**


###  Aggregation & Analytics

* Monthly aggregation
* KPIs:

  * Total Revenue
  * Total Quantity
  * Average Order Value (AOV)


###  Denormalized Data Model

* **Reduced query-time complexity** by creating a denormalized view with all relevant columns
* Enabled efficient dashboarding and faster analytics


###  File Lifecycle Management

Data flow:

```
Landing → Processing 
```

* Automated file movement using `dbutils.fs.mv()` for lifecycle management
* Leveraged Delta Lake (DeltaTable) to implement MERGE-based upserts, enabling incremental, idempotent pipelines that prevent duplicate processing by writing only new and updated record.
